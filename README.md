# Genesis Playground

Docker container for testing the [Genesis simulator](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

Build the image by running the `build.sh` script.
Run the container with the `launch.sh` script (if it already running, it will open a new terminal in it).

This repository already includes all the original [Genesis example files](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/tree/main/examples).
Please, refer to the [Genesis User Guide](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/index.html) for major details.
